Welcome to LOCKDONE Capture the Flag event, by [AFNOM](https://afnom.net), the
University of Birmingham Ethical Hacking Society!

We love computer hacking and we thought this would be a great opportunity to
introduce other people to the world of cyber-security and puzzles.

## When and where? 

The CTF will run from Wednesday, 19th of August, 12PM, until 26th of August,
12PM.

Website URL **to be announced**

Meanwhile, join the [Discord
channel](https://discord.gg/hRZbjWV), and say hi! Any of the people with the
**Flagmaster** role are CTF admins. If you have any questions about the CTF,
need technical help or you're looking for a team, the Discord server is the
place to be!

## What is a CTF?
CTFs are competitive cyber-security events where opposing teams solve hacking
puzzles to earn prizes. The events range from beginner-friendly to incredibly
sophisticated international competitions between the best teams in the world.

## So how challenging will LOCKDONE CTF be?

We designed LOCKDONE CTF to be fun and educational rather than impossibly
challenging :-)

Every challenge should be solvable **without any previous experience** of hacking
and they are designed to teach you something new about how computers work and
your personal security.

We really want as many people as possible to take part and come away having
learnt something new about the world of cyber-security.

Our challenges are arranged in layers of difficulty, Easy, Medium and Hard.
We would recommend you start at Easy but it's not mandatory, if you want you can
jump right into the Hard category.

Each challenge will be self-contained and will have **hints and resources** for
introducing you to the techniques needed to solve it, so you should be able to
go from knowing nothing about a subject or having some theoretical knowledge to
having done some hacking and solved an actual example of that technique!


## How it works

Each team creates an account on the score-tracker website (scoreboard) and
works together to solve the challenges there.

CTFs are all about 'flags' and 'challenges'. A 'challenge' is a puzzle you have
to solve, when you solve it you get a 'flag', then you put the flag into the
scoreboard website to prove you solved the puzzle and your team gets points!

A flag is a piece of text that looks like this: `LOCK{this_1s_4_fl4g}`. It
ALWAYS starts with `LOCK{`, then has a phrase, with spaces replaced with
underscores and some vowels with numbers and finally another `}`.

Every challenge will have a flag that looks like that hidden somewhere in it,
it could be encrypted or hidden in a website or an image, and you have to
recover it. When you do go back to the scoring website and enter the flag into
the relevant challenge to claim your points.

At the end of the CTF, the team with the most points will win!

Once the CTF website is up, we will have step-by-step details of how to create
your account and how to play!
