Welcome to LOCKDONE Capture the Flag event, by [AFNOM](https://afnom.net), the
University of Birmingham Ethical Hacking Society!

We love computer hacking and we thought this would be a great opportunity to
introduce other people to the world of cyber-security and puzzles.

Unfortunately, we've finished the event, there are no more challenges to do!
However, if you enjoyed the event, and want to learn more about
cybersecurity, you might be interested in joining our Ethical Hacking
Society. Our discord server is <https://discord.gg/JpZ2CgX> and you can find
out more about as at our website at <https://afnom.net> ðŸ˜Š
