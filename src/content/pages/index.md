## What is it?

The LOCKDONE-athon is both a week-long creative marathon (inspired by
hackathons) and a week-long cybersecurity Capture the Flag event, in which you
can learn new skills, build a project that impacts the people and communities
around you, and get the chance to invent something new with like-minded
students. Keep on reading below to find out more about the hackathon, or head
over to the [LOCKDONE Capture the Flag](/ctf) page to learn about the CTF!
The events start a few days apart, so you can take part in both!

## What can I make?

Over the week, you'll have the chance to use your skills - including those
from LOCKDONE, to build something great - whether that's a small piece of
research, an informative poster, a campaign, an app, or anything else you can
think of; the sky's the limit! As long as it's a "thing" that you've made,
that counts!

At the end of the week though, you'll get the chance to show off your project
and see what everyone else has gotten up to as well 😮

## What are the categories?

The categories all match up with the goals setup by the [Birmingham in Action
campaign](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/birmingham-in-action/index.aspx):

- An education for all
- Preventing and treating cancer
- Protecting our planet
- Young people’s mental health
- Families fleeing war, violence, and famine
- Those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic

You can read more about each category and some possible ideas and directions
to take your project in [here](/challenges).

## How do I get involved?

Getting involved is _super_ easy.

First off, you can join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/hRZbjWV)! If you've
got questions, you can ask for clarification from the organizers, get
technical help from mentors, or if you haven't got a team, you can meet other
students and find a group of people to build something with!

Next, find a team of people you want to work with, and decide on _roughly_
what you want to build.

Finally, when the event starts, get together with your team, and start making
something awesome 🎉

## When does it start?

The event starts on the 17th of August, and we've got all sorts of different
workshops and learning sessions planned, so that you can build the best
possible project.

The [Capture the Flag competition](/ctf) will start on 19th of August, so you
have time to start your project!
